		<h2 id="about">About Balasaheb Thackeray</h2>
		
		<p>Balasaheb Keshav Thackeray (23 January 1926 â€“ 17 November 2012) was an Indian politician who founded the Shiv Sena, a right-wing Marathi ethnocentric party active mainly in the western state of Maharashtra. Thackeray began his professional career as a cartoonist with the English-language daily The Free Press Journal in Mumbai, but left it in 1960 to form his own political weekly Marmik. His political philosophy was largely shaped by his father Keshav Sitaram Thackeray, a leading figure in the Samyukta Maharashtra (United Maharashtra) movement, which advocated for the creation of a separate state of Maharashtra.</p>
		<p>Thackeray founded the Shiv Sena in 1966 with the aim of fighting for the rights of the Marathi-speaking population in Mumbai. The party quickly gained a large following, and Thackeray became one of the most influential political figures in Maharashtra. He was known for his controversial speeches and writings, which often targeted immigrants and Muslims.</p>
		<p>Thackeray never held an official position in government, but his influence on Maharashtra politics was immense. He was seen as a champion of Marathi identity and culture, and his populist message resonated with many working-class voters in Mumbai and beyond.</p>

		<h2 id="legacy">Legacy</h2>
		<p>Thackeray's legacy is a mixed one. On the one hand, he is widely admired by his supporters for his bold and uncompromising leadership style, his commitment to Marathi interests, and his ability to connect with ordinary people. On the other hand, he is also criticized by many for his divisive rhetoric, his often-violent tactics, and his efforts to polarize Maharashtra society along linguistic and religious lines.</p>
		<p>Despite the controversy surrounding his legacy, there is no denying that Thackeray was a major force in Maharashtra politics for more than four decades. His impact on the state's political and social landscape continues to be felt to this day.</p>
